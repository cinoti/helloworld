Entropy Red Shift of Electromagnetic Waves in a Space Vacuum

I shall start with the observation that the current view of
EM waves passing through a space vacuum without paying
some price in energy is analogous to a perpetual motion machine.
Once launched an EM wave can travel on forever.

I invoke the second law of thermodynamics as stated by
Rudolf Clausius 
“in any irreversible process a small amount of heat energy delta Q
 is incrementally dissipated across the system boundary.”

I propose that any electromagnetic wave cycle in a so called
‘space-vacuum’ represents an irreversible process.

I use entropy to represent the idea that each cycle of
expansion and compression of an EM wave traveling in
a space vacuum will experience a loss of some amount 
of energy into the vacuum. The electromagnetic fabric of space.

In this process of decaying, a wavelength will pass through many
zones  and bands. Ergo, Lyman-Alpha will eventually become Balmer-Alpha
and so on.

The essential equation of EM wave motion is  lambda(n+1) = lambda(n)+gamma,
so that each cycle adds a small amount of wavelength, corresponding to the energy 
given up to the (so-called) vacuum or  Fabric of Space.

$\lambda_(n+1) = \lambda_n+\gamma$

gamma $\gamma$ is the wavelength expansion constant, expressed as length.

$\gamma = k * \alpha / 4 * \pi$

$k      = Planck Len = 1.616229e^-35$  meters,
$\alpha  = fine-structure-constant = 0.072973525663,$
$\gamma  = 9.385520393125562e^-39$ m

A very simple idea, but with enormous consequences.
