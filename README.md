Entropy Red Shift of Electromagnetic Waves in a Space Vacuum

I shall start with the observation that the current view of
EM waves passing through a space vacuum without paying
some price in energy is analogous to a perpetual motion machine.
Once launched an EM wave can travel on forever.

I invoke the second law of thermodynamics as stated by
Rudolf Clausius 
“in any irreversible process a small amount of heat energy delta Q
 is incrementally dissipated across the system boundary.”

I propose that any electromagnetic wave cycle in a so called
‘space-vacuum’ represents an irreversible process.

I use entropy to represent the idea that each cycle of
expansion and compression of an EM wave traveling in
a space vacuum will experience a loss of some amount 
of energy into the vacuum. The electromagnetic fabric of space.

In this process of frequency decaying, a wavelength will pass through many
zones  and bands. Ergo, Lyman-Alpha will eventually become Balmer-Alpha
and so on, as the wave length increases.

The essential equation of EM wave expansion is  lambda(n+1) = lambda(n)+gamma,
so that each cycle adds a small amount of wavelength, corresponding to the energy 
given up to the (so-called) vacuum or  Fabric of Space.

$\lambda_(n+1) = \lambda_n+\gamma$ where $\gamma = k * \alpha / 4 * \pi$ and $\gamma  = 9.385520393125562e^-39$ m

As a function of time. $\lambda_(t+1) = \lambda_t+(\gamma C / \lambda_t  )$

$k      = Planck Len = 1.616229e^-35$  meters,
$\alpha$  = fine-structure-constant = 0.072973525663

gamma $\gamma$ is the wavelength expansion constant, expressed as length.

One way to test this idea is to note that all derived Z data is
assumed to have expanded at the same rate.
But if this gamma idea is true then one might expect noticable 
inconsistancies in expansion rates at lower frequencies, as in
long wave infrared. Why? because most data collected is based on
much higher frequencies ,Lyman, Balmer, that decay much faster than
lower frequencies, so if a super low frequency were selected as the
basis for some measurement, then it will be off, from the expectation
derived from the Hubble Constant.
